# Dynamic Multi-Section Landing Page

## Project Description

Often times, you won't know how much content a page will hold or how much will be added later through a CMS or API. To handle this, we can build out our page content dynamically. In this project, we use JavaScript and manipulation of the DOM to enhance usability and add functionality to an otherwise static webpage.

The primary behavior of the landing page is as follows:

* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
* Sections have a highlighted active state
* Navigation links scroll to their corresponding section

Most of the app's functionality is built out in `js/app.js` which works together with our `index.html` and styles in `css/styles.css`.
